## 📜 Synopsis

The Kingdom of Solaris was long ruled by the magical Valerian bloodline. The player controls **King Aldric Valerian**, the last royal of this bloodline.

The kingdom’s most trusted guard, **Luminas, "The Keeper,"** grew envious of the King’s power and status. Driven by greed, The Keeper resorted to forbidden dark magic to usurp the King. The spell failed, shattering the King's memories and scattering them across the lands.

King Aldric must now embark on a perilous journey to locate the Memory Trees, reclaim his fragmented memories, and return to his Castle to defeat The Keeper and reclaim his rightful throne.
